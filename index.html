            <p> My dearesttttttttttt husband, I want you to know that I love you the most in this world ❤️. Meeting you felt like fate, and what has kept us together is truly a blessing. With you, I feel like I've been given a new chance to live, and I absolutely can't wait to get married to you.

I know there are some problems we are facing right now, but I can assure you that when this is all over, we will be living the absolute best of our lives.

I love you sooooooo much, and you mean the world to me. No matter how much we fight, no matter the obstacles and all our differences, I just pray we can be together forever and ever. Nothing in the world can come between us—and now that we're virtually married, I can't wait for it to happen in real life 🤭🤭🤭🤭!

I love you very much. You are the sole reason for my existence and the best of the bestest thing that has ever happened to me.

Never forget that, okay?

I love you ❤️❤️❤️ Muahhhhhhhh 💋💋💋 </p>
